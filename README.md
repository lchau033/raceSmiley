# raceSmiley

Project given in Artificial Intelligence class where 
two smileys were placed in a maze and tried finding 
the exit with moving as little as possible using a 
simulation of the Star algorithm where the estimation 
was done using the number of tiles in order to get to the exit 
and adding two if one of those tiles were an obstacle in the maze
